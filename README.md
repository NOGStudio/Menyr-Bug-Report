If you encounter any technical issues or bugs while using Menyr, we invite you to report them so that our team can review and resolve them quickly. Your contribution is essential in helping us improve the engine.

1. **Check Existing Issues**: Before reporting a bug, take a quick peek at the "Issues" section at the top of this page. This helps us keep things organized and ensures we're all on the same bug-crushing adventure!

2. **Gather Necessary Information**: To give our talented team a clear picture of the bug, we need your help! Snap some screenshots of the issue (visuals are always a blast!), wrote the steps to reproduce it (like a treasure map!), and share any relevant other information.

3. **Submit a New Issue**: Hop on over to the "Issues" section and click on the "New Issue" button. Alternatively, you can use this link: [New Issue](https://github.com/NOGStudio/Menyr-Feedback/issues/new/choose)
