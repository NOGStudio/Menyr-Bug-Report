If you encounter any technical issues or bugs while using the application, we invite you to report them so that our team can review and resolve them quickly. Your contribution is essential in helping us improve Menyr.

1. **Check Existing Issues**: Before reporting a bug, take a quick peek at the "Issues" section. This helps us keep things organized and ensures we're all on the same bug-crushing adventure!

2. **Gather Necessary Information**: To give our talented team a clear picture of the bug, we need your help! Snap some screenshots of the issue (visuals are always a blast!), wrote the steps to reproduce it (like a treasure map!), and share any relevant other information.

3. **Submit a New Issue**: Hop on over to the "Issues" section and click on the "New Issue" button. Alternatively, you can use this link: [New Issue](https://github.com/NOGStudio/Menyr-Feedback/issues/new/choose)

Thank you for your proactive involvement in improving Menyr! Your bug reports and feedback play a vital role in refining our application and creating the best possible user experience. We genuinely appreciate your contribution.
